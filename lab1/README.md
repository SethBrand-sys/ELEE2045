This lab was good in showing me how closely related Matlab and Python. I did fine in the plotting and assigning all the right variables in the right places, but I struggled with the actual circuits part of it. Converting the Python code to Matlab was relatively easy (because they are so closely related), but it just took some time. Other than that, there wasn't much trouble in writing the code or in getting the lab done.



1. The solution and I both had two decimal places shown with .2f, but I used a % instead of :. I learned now that the : is easier, and it works in more cases.
2. Instead of putting the values for the plot in directly to the plt.bar() function, I made numpy arrays to make it easier to find where the values are input in the code.
3. I used the fig, ax = plt.subplots() way of making a matplotlib plot, but the solution way of making a bar graph does the same thing. It just isn't stored in a figure.
