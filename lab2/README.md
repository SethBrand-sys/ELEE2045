This lab introduced me to the M5StickCPlus for the first time, and it helped me get acquainted with arduino verifying, uploading, and files. I didn't realize how useful this stick could be for coding projects because it's so small and can do so much. This lab helped me revisit some python graphing and csv reading. The main challenges I faced were trying to read from the csv file and uploading to the stick. I neglected to think about what class was being returned when I read the csv into my lists in part 3, and I forgot that I had to turn them into integers for matplotlib to be able to interpret them. The main issue I had (with the stick) was when I tried uploading to it, but I always seemed to either change my environment or download something fron the arduino website (it didn't take that long -- only 30 minutes).
